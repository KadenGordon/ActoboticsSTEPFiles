# ActoboticsSTEPFiles
This repository is for STEP files for Actobotics pieces. This is run and maintained by Beehive Robotics FTC Team 3648.
Most files are official from servocity.com, unless otherwise specified (if a file is a .prt insead of .step, that is another sign it is unofficial).
The folder system is set up the same way as servocity.com. If you contribute to this, please keep it that way.
